Purpose: This program is a Tournament Tracker. It tracks the progression of wins over a series of tournaments. 
 
   Organization: the Team.cs class keeps track of team data, such as name, score and if they are still competing.
    The Play.cs class keeps track of which team is playing against which other team. The MainMenu.cs class keeps the
    clutter of the menus separate from the Main program. The Graphics.cs class is not functional yet. 
    
   Description: Using the menu options, you can create teams by entering their name and enter their scores as they 
    progress in the tournament. You need to calculate who won after each round, then enter new scores after each round.
